instagram-clone-rails
=====================

A very basic instagram clone, built on Ruby on Rails.
Makers Challenge #08

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need users who can post pictures, write comments on pictures and like a picture. It will need to look like the instagrams website or better. 
Breakdown of models:
- User
- Post
- Comment/description
- like

Bonus if you can add filters :P
